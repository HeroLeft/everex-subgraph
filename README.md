# Data from Everex Token Contract
SubGraph takes information about events directly from the smart contract and allows you to get information about the owners, transfers and approvals.

A live version of this subgraph can be found [here](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/heroleft/everex), along with useful queries and examples already available on the playground.
